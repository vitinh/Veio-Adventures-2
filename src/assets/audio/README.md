# Audio Assets

This directory should contain the following audio files:

1. `step.wav` - Player footstep sound
2. `impact.wav` - Impact/collision sound

Since we can't actually create audio files in this context, you would need to add appropriate WAV or MP3 files here.

## Recommended free sound sources:
- [Freesound.org](https://freesound.org/)
- [OpenGameArt.org](https://opengameart.org/)
- [Kenney Game Assets](https://kenney.nl/assets/category:Audio)

## Audio Format Recommendations:
- Use WAV format for the best compatibility with Electron
- Keep file sizes small (under 100KB per effect) for better performance
- Use 44.1kHz, 16-bit, mono for sound effects
